 # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Provide insights gained from exploratory data analysis. This can include summary statistics, data visualizations, and any interesting patterns or trends observed in the data.

# Data Preprocessing
Detail the data preprocessing steps you performed before building models. This may include handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

# Model Building
Describe the machine learning models you experimented with for credit card fraud detection. Include details such as the algorithms used, hyperparameters tuned, and any techniques employed to handle imbalanced data.

# Evaluation
Discuss how you evaluated the performance of your models. This can include metrics used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), cross-validation techniques, and any insights gained from the evaluation process.

# Conclusion
Summarize your findings and conclusions from the project. Reflect on the effectiveness of the models built, any challenges encountered, and potential future work.
